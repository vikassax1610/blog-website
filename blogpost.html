        Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and
        semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal language. Languages
        usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and
        mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming
        language is required in order to execute programs, namely an interpreter
        or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a
        compiler produces an executable program. Computer architecture has
        strongly influenced the design of programming languages, with the most
        common type (imperative languages—which implement operations in a
        specified order) developed to perform well on the popular von Neumann
        architecture. While early programming languages were closely tied to the
        hardware, over time they have developed more abstraction to hide
        implementation details for greater simplicity. Thousands of programming
        languages—often classified as imperative, functional, logic, or
        object-oriented—have been developed for a wide variety of uses. Many
        aspects of programming language design involve tradeoffs—for example,
        exception handling simplifies error handling, but at a performance cost.
        Programming language theory is the subfield of computer science that
        studies the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and
        classification of programming languages.
